# Election Audit with Python  

## Overview of Election Audit 
The purpose of this project was to assist in completing an audit for a local congressional election. This required us to calculate things like total number of votes and number of votes each candidate received to build a readable report from the initial data that was provided. This data included ballot ID, county, and candidate name.   

### Election Audit Results 
The total amount of votes that were collected in the congressional election was 369,711. This put the final number of county votes as followed: 

•	Denver contributing the most votes at 82.8% 

•	Jefferson in second with 10.5%

•	Arapahoe in third with 6.7% 

With this information we were able to conclude that the highest voter turn out for this election was based from Denver. As for the candidates we were able to conclude which induvial won the overall election. 

•	Diana DeGette received the most votes at 73.8% 

•	Charles Casper Stockham followed second with 23% of the votes. 

•	Raymon Anthony Doane came in third with 3.1% of the votes.  


## Election Audit Summary 
For this project and with this script we were easily able to identify the information we needed. By modifying the script, we were able to breakdown and provide the county information among voters. We could have expanded on this information to include voter demographics such as age and gender. That way we would have not only been able to identify the county but which demographics subjugated each.
